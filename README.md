# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

For this part of the Challenge, you’ll write a report to help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."

## Overview of the analysis
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
